/**
 * Produces connection events.
 * <p>
 * The interface is intended to be implemented by setups which are interested in receiving technical connection events.
 * Which might not make sense for all protocols adapters. But mostly for connection oriented ones like MQTT or AMQP 1.0.
 * <p>
 * The protocol adapters may call {@link #connected(String, String, Device, JsonObject)} and
 * {@link #disconnected(String, String, Device, JsonObject)} as they see fit. The whole process is a "best effort"
 * process and intended to be used for monitoring/debugging.
 * <p>
 * When a protocol adapter calls into this producer it must provide some kind of connection ID, which might have a
 * different meaning for different protocol adapters. This should be as identifiable as possible but there is no
 * requirement for this to be unique. However for each connection the protocol adapter must call
 * {@link #disconnected(String, String, Device, JsonObject)} with the same information as it called
 * {@link #connected(String, String, Device, JsonObject)}.
